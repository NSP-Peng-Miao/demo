Depression is a common and serious mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide, especially adolescents. According to Cheryl et al. (2018) , depression is the most prevalent mental disorder among adolescents, affecting about 1-year prevalence of between 4 and 5% of young people. Depression can impair adolescents’ academic performance, social relationships, and physical health, and increase their risk of suicide and substance abuse. Therefore, it is important to understand the causes and risk factors of adolescent depression, and to explore the possible ways to prevent or treat it. In this essay, I will discuss how parental psychological neglect, peer isolation, prevention strategies, school-based approaches, and brain stimulation techniques can influence adolescent depression, based on the evidence from various sources. I will argue that adolescent depression can be prevented or reduced by providing supportive and nurturing environments for adolescents, and by offering innovative and effective treatments for those who suffer from it.

One of the main causes of adolescent depression is the lack of parental support and care. Parental psychological neglect, which is defined as the failure to provide adequate emotional warmth, empathy, and guidance to the child, can have detrimental effects on the child’s mental health and development. According to Christ et al. (2017) , parental psychological neglect can increase the risk of adolescent depression by affecting the child’s self-esteem, attachment security, and cognitive functioning. Moreover, parental psychological neglect can also lead to peer isolation, which is another risk factor for adolescent depression. Peer isolation, which is the lack of social interaction and support from peers, can exacerbate the feelings of loneliness, sadness, and hopelessness that are associated with depression. Glickman et al. (2021) found that peer social support can buffer the negative impact of parental psychological neglect on adolescent depression, and that peer isolation can mediate the relationship between parental psychological neglect and adolescent depression. Therefore, it is important to provide adequate parental support and care to adolescents, and to help them develop positive and meaningful relationships with their peers. In the next paragraph, I will discuss how prevention strategies and school-based approaches can help reduce adolescent depression.

Another way to reduce adolescent depression is to implement prevention strategies and school-based approaches that can help adolescents cope with stress, enhance their resilience, and improve their well-being. Prevention strategies are interventions that aim to prevent the onset or recurrence of depression among adolescents who are at risk or have subthreshold symptoms. According to Cheryl et al. (2018) , prevention strategies can be classified into three types: universal, selective, and indicated. Universal prevention strategies target all adolescents regardless of their risk level, such as school-wide mental health promotion programs or anti-bullying campaigns. Selective prevention strategies target adolescents who have specific risk factors for depression, such as family history, trauma, or low socioeconomic status. Indicated prevention strategies target adolescents who have already shown signs of depression, such as low mood, irritability, or suicidal thoughts. Cheryl et al. (2018) reviewed the evidence for various prevention strategies and found that they can be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing the onset of major depressive disorder among adolescents, especially when they are delivered in school settings.

School-based approaches are interventions that are integrated into the school curriculum or environment, and that aim to improve the mental health and academic outcomes of adolescents. According to Krishna et al. (2020) , school-based approaches can be divided into two categories: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBI). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that teaches adolescents how to identify and challenge their negative thoughts and behaviors, and how to cope with stressful situations. MBI is a type of meditation that teaches adolescents how to pay attention to their present moment experiences, and how to accept and regulate their emotions. Krishna et al. (2020) evaluated the effectiveness of various school-based approaches and found that they can significantly reduce depressive symptoms and improve academic performance and social skills among adolescents, especially when they are delivered by trained professionals or teachers.

The implications of the evidence are that prevention strategies and school-based approaches can be beneficial for adolescents who are at risk or suffer from depression, and that they can be easily implemented and accessed in school settings. The limitations of the evidence are that the studies used different methods and measures to assess the outcomes, and that the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of the interventions are unclear. Therefore, more standardized and rigorous research is needed to compare the efficacy and feasibility of different prevention strategies and school-based approaches for adolescent depression. In the next paragraph, I will discuss how brain stimulation techniques can help treat adolescent depression.

A final way to treat adolescent depression is to use brain stimulation techniques that can modulate the activity of specific brain regions or networks that are involved in mood regulation. Brain stimulation techniques are non-invasive or minimally invasive procedures that use electric currents, magnetic fields, or ultrasound waves to stimulate or inhibit the brain. According to Adam (2022) , brain stimulation techniques can offer cautious hope for adolescents with depression, especially those who do not respond to conventional treatments such as medication or psychotherapy. Adam (2022) explained that brain stimulation techniques can target the brain regions or circuits that are dysfunctional in depression, such as the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, or the limbic system, and that they can restore the normal functioning of these areas by enhancing or suppressing their activity.

One of the most promising brain stimulation techniques for adolescent depression is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a non-invasive procedure that uses a coil to generate a magnetic field that induces an electric current in the brain. TMS can be applied to different brain regions with different frequencies and intensities, depending on the desired effect. According to Paul and Frank (2019) , TMS can be effective in treating adolescent depression by stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is a brain region that is involved in executive functions, emotion regulation, and cognitive control. Paul and Frank (2019) reviewed the evidence for TMS in adolescent depression and found that it can significantly reduce depressive symptoms and improve quality of life, with minimal side effects and high tolerability.

The implications of the evidence are that brain stimulation techniques can be a novel and innovative option for adolescents with depression, and that they can offer advantages over conventional treatments, such as higher efficacy, lower adverse effects, and shorter duration. The limitations of the evidence are that the studies used small sample sizes, heterogeneous populations, and variable protocols, and that the mechanisms and long-term effects of brain stimulation techniques are still unclear. Therefore, more large-scale and standardized research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of brain stimulation techniques for adolescent depression. In the conclusion, I will restate the thesis statement and summarize the main points of the essay.

In conclusion, adolescent depression is a serious and prevalent mental health problem that can have negative consequences for adolescents’ well-being and development. In this essay, I have discussed how parental psychological neglect, peer isolation, prevention strategies, school-based approaches, and brain stimulation techniques can influence adolescent depression, based on the evidence from various sources. I have argued that adolescent depression can be prevented or reduced by providing supportive and nurturing environments for adolescents, and by offering innovative and effective treatments for those who suffer from it. Some recommendations or suggestions for future research or practice on adolescent depression are: to conduct more rigorous and valid studies to confirm the causal relationships and mechanisms of the factors and interventions discussed in this essay; to compare the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of different prevention strategies and school-based approaches for adolescent depression; and to establish the safety and efficacy of brain stimulation techniques for adolescent depression in large-scale and standardized trials. By doing so, we can hope to improve the mental health and quality of life of adolescents who are affected by depression. Adolescent depression is not a hopeless condition, but a challenge that can be overcome with the help of research, practice, and policy.
